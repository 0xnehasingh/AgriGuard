## üîß Next Steps

### Step 1: Complete NEAR Login
You need to complete the NEAR login process that was started:

```bash
near login
```

**Instructions:**
1. The command should open your browser to https://testnet.mynearwallet.com/
2. Create a new account or sign in with an existing one
3. Choose an account name like `agriguard.testnet` or `your-name.testnet`
4. Authorize the CLI application
5. Complete the login process

### Step 2: Fund Your Account
Once logged in, fund your testnet account:

1. **Visit the faucet:** https://near-faucet.io/
2. **Enter your account ID:** `your-account.testnet`
3. **Request testnet NEAR tokens** (you'll need ~10-50 NEAR for testing)

### Step 3: Deploy the Contract
Navigate to the NEAR project and deploy:

```bash
cd agriguard-js
npm install
npm run build
npm run deploy
```

### Step 4: Update Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in your main project root:

```bash
cp .env.template .env
```

Update the `.env` file with your actual values:
```env
# Your NEAR testnet account ID
TESTNET_ACCOUNT=your-account.testnet

# Your contract deployment address (usually same as account)
CONTRACT_NAME=your-account.testnet

# Your private key (found in ~/.near-credentials/testnet/your-account.testnet.json)
PRIVATE_KEY=your-private-key-here
```

## üß™ Testing the Contract

### View Contract Stats
```bash
near view your-account.testnet getContractStats
```

### Create a Test Policy
```bash
near call your-account.testnet createPolicy \
  --args '{
    "cropType": "wheat",
    "farmLocation": {"lat": 40.7128, "lng": -74.0060},
    "coverageAmount": "1000000000000000000000000",
    "startDate": "2024-01-01",
    "endDate": "2024-12-31",
    "weatherParameters": {
      "minTemp": 5,
      "maxTemp": 30,
      "minRainfall": 300,
      "maxRainfall": 1000
    }
  }' \
  --accountId your-account.testnet \
  --amount 50
```

### Submit Weather Data (as oracle)
```bash
near call your-account.testnet submitWeatherData \
  --args '{
    "stationId": "station_001",
    "temperature": 35,
    "rainfall": 50,
    "humidity": 60,
    "windSpeed": 15
  }' \
  --accountId your-account.testnet
```

## üîó Frontend Integration

### Initialize NEAR in Your React App

```typescript
// In your main App.tsx or layout component
import { initNEAR } from './lib/near-integration';

// Initialize NEAR
const contractId = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ID || 'your-account.testnet';
const nearAgriGuard = initNEAR(contractId);

// Check if user is signed in
if (nearAgriGuard.isSignedIn()) {
  console.log('User signed in:', nearAgriGuard.getAccountId());
}
```

### Create a Policy from Frontend

```typescript
import { getNEAR } from './lib/near-integration';

const createPolicy = async () => {
  const near = getNEAR();
  
  try {
    const policyId = await near.createPolicy(
      'wheat',                              // crop type
      { lat: 40.7128, lng: -74.0060 },     // farm location
      '100',                               // coverage amount in NEAR
      '2024-01-01',                        // start date
      '2024-12-31',                        // end date
      {                                    // weather parameters
        minTemp: 5,
        maxTemp: 30,
        minRainfall: 300,
        maxRainfall: 1000
      }
    );
    
    console.log('Policy created:', policyId);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error creating policy:', error);
  }
};
```

### File a Claim from Frontend

```typescript
import { getNEAR } from './lib/near-integration';

const fileClaim = async (policyId: string, weatherData: any) => {
  const near = getNEAR();
  
  try {
    const claimId = await near.fileClaim(
      policyId,
      'Extreme weather conditions',
      weatherData
    );
    
    console.log('Claim filed:', claimId);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error filing claim:', error);
  }
};
```

## üìä WeatherXM Integration

### Submit WeatherXM Data to Contract

```typescript
import { getNEAR } from './lib/near-integration';
import { fetchWeatherData } from './lib/weatherxm';

const submitWeatherData = async (stationId: string) => {
  const near = getNEAR();
  
  try {
    // Fetch data from WeatherXM
    const weatherData = await fetchWeatherData(stationId);
    
    // Submit to NEAR contract
    await near.submitWeatherXMData(weatherData);
    
    console.log('Weather data submitted to contract');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error submitting weather data:', error);
  }
};
```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Commands

### Build Contract
```bash
cd agriguard-js
npm run build
```

### Run Tests
```bash
cd agriguard-js
npm run test
```

### Deploy Contract
```bash
cd agriguard-js
npm run deploy
```

### View Contract Methods
```bash
near view your-account.testnet getContractStats
```

## üîê Security Considerations

### Private Key Management
- **Never commit private keys** to version control
- Store private keys securely in environment variables
- Use different keys for development and production

### Contract Security
- The contract includes authorization checks for oracles
- Only the contract owner can add/remove weather oracles
- Policies are validated before creation

### Testing Best Practices
- Always test on testnet before mainnet deployment
- Verify contract behavior with edge cases
- Test automatic claim processing thoroughly
