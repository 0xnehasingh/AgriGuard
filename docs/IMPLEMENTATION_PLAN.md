### **Live Demo Flow**

#### **Setup (Before Demo)**
- Reset demo data to clean state
- Ensure all services are running
- Prepare multiple browser tabs
- Test WeatherXM API connectivity

#### **Demo Script**

**1. Landing Page (30 seconds)**
```
"Welcome to AgriGuard. Notice the 'Powered by WeatherXM' branding - 
this isn't just integration, it's a true partnership. See this live 
weather widget? That's real data from WeatherXM's network."

[Scroll through features, highlight 8000+ stations]
```

**2. Insurance Application (2 minutes)**
```
"Let's follow Maria's journey. She enters her farm location in Brazil...
[Type address] ...and immediately AgriGuard finds the nearest WeatherXM 
stations. Look - 2.3km away with live data.

She selects coffee as her crop. Notice how the system automatically 
suggests realistic values based on Brazilian coffee farming.

Coverage period from planting to harvest... and here's the magic - 
real-time risk assessment powered by WeatherXM historical data.

Risk score: 35% - medium risk due to recent drought patterns. The system 
identified three key triggers: drought, excess rain, and heat stress."
```

**3. Quote & Purchase (1 minute)**
```
"Premium calculation is transparent: base rate plus risk adjustment plus 
platform fee. $347 premium for $15,000 coverage - that's affordable 
micro-insurance.

The triggers are crystal clear: if rainfall drops below 20mm for 30 days, 
automatic $9,000 payout. No claims, no waiting, no bureaucracy."

[Click purchase - show loading state]
```

**4. Dashboard (1 minute)**
```
"Policy is now active and monitoring weather 24/7. The dashboard shows 
current conditions from her assigned WeatherXM station, trigger status, 
and payout history.

This isn't mock data - it's connected to real WeatherXM stations. If 
weather triggers activate, payouts happen automatically via smart contract."
```

**5. Technical Deep Dive (30 seconds)**
```
"Under the hood: smart contracts deployed on Polygon, WeatherXM API 
integration, ML risk models, and multi-chain architecture. This is 
production-ready code that can scale to millions of farmers."
